## What Languages did you use to make a website
## 1- HTML 
short for Hyper Text Markup Language every website requires html.
## 2- CSS
CSS short for Cascading Style Sheets if you want the code to link your CSS to your html heres the code put it in the header html
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<css name>.css">
```
## 3- JavaScript
JS short for JavaScript is important to create a interactive experience for the user who is visiting the site/website. Even heres the code of how to link your javascript to your html website
```
<script src="<jsname>.js"></script>
```
## How did you make your website?
I used a website called pages.github.com but the website is not drag and drop, you have to make a public github repository with a index.html, The Index File is important because the browser always goes to the index.html stored in your website. heres an example
https://git20200.gq/index.html 
<br>
you don't need to add the index.html because the browser always goes to the index file so you could remove the /index.html so it will be like this
<br>
https://git20200.gq
## Is it easy to make a website with html?
Yes it is easy but it will be like this if you don't use CSS

## How do I add CSS?
you make a CSS file on your system then upload it in your public github repository. it should be like this
https://git20200.gq/examplecss
